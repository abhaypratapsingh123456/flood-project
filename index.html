        <p>A flood is an overflow of water that submerges land that is usually dry. In the sense of "flowing water", the word may also be applied to the inflow of the tide.
            Floods are an area of study of the discipline hydrology and are of significant concern in agriculture, civil engineering and public health.</p>

                                Overview. Floods are the most frequent type of natural disaster and occur when 
                                 an overflow of water submerges land that is usually dry.
                                  Floods are often caused by heavy rainfall, rapid snowmelt or a storm surge from a tropical cyclone or tsunami in coastal areas.Floods are the most frequent type of natural disaster and occur when an overflow of water submerges land that is usually dry.

                                  Floods can cause widespread devastation, resulting in loss of life and damages to personal property and critical public health infrastructure.

                                It occurs when drainage channels are filled and the rivers and streams can no longer accommodate the excessive water generated by severe weather conditions. The drainage channels then overtop their natural or artificial banks and water enters the surrounding lands to cause flooding.Between 1998-2017, floods affected more than 2 billion people worldwide. People who live in floodplains or non-resistant buildings, or lack warning systems and awareness of flooding hazard, are most vulnerable to floods.

                            Floods – Definition and Different Causes of Floods 
                            <a rel="nofollow" href="https://templatemo.com" class="tm-color-primary"> causes </a>
                            Flood is a term used to denote an enormous amount of water.
                             When there is an outflow of water in a place, it is said to be flooded.
                               The situation caused when the water becomes uncontrollable is said to be flooded.
                                 The flood may take different forms such as in the form of heavy rainfall when there is a breaking of the dam.
                                  Furthermore, the melting of snow also leads to flooding. Floods lead to an overfull and huge spread of water but are not considered safe for the purpose of drinking.
                                   Thus floods bring with them a number of diseases such as typhoid, cholera and many others. Here, we shall discuss the various causes of floods.

                            CAUSES OF FLOOD
                        Flood is usually a result of natural causes. It may also be caused by man-made factors.
                         It causes huge damage to life and property.
                        There are many different causes leading to flooding. Some prominent among them include:
                        </em>
                        <p>
                            Massive Rainfall
                            Drainage systems and the effective infrastructure design aid during heavy rains. They help the drainage of excess water into reservoirs in an easy way. But in cases of heavy rainfall, the systems stop working. Thus flood is caused.


                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Overflowing of the Rivers
The people living along the river always have a risk of life from the overflowing of the Rivers. To prevent such a situation, a string of dams are built. However, if these dams are not managed properly, they may cause flooding and huge damage.

Collapsed Dams

                                Collapsed Dams
                                In the event of huge rainfall, the dams built begin to collapse. 
                                Thus, causing the flood situation to become even critical for the people living around.

                                At the time of the high melting of snow due to heavy precipitation and other factors, the situation of flooding arises.
                                 Adopting sustainable measures for heavy precipitation can help in dealing with the flooding situation.

                            Climate change
                            The climatic changes caused due to human practices also add to the risk of flooding.
                             Human beings cut trees in a large number, thus affecting the process of photosynthesis.
                             Thus increased level of carbon-di-oxide in the atmosphere cause changes in climate posing threats of natural disasters like floods etc.

                        <p>
                            Emission of Greenhouse Gases
                        The burning of fossil fuels, the industrial influences, the pollution all is depleting the level of the ozone layer and increasing the level of greenhouse gases, becoming a major cause of man-made flooding..
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Taking steps such as afforestation, decreased the emission of harmful gases into the atmosphere could help.
                             Also, enrichment of vegetation, fewer deeds causing pollution and treatment of sewage could be useful ways to combat the situation.

                        New Delhi: The Kerala flood rescue operation was the largest disaster relief exercise the Air Force has ever conducted, with its powerful aircraft dropping a total of 2.47 lakh kg of relief material. The Air Force had to pinpoint areas that were inaccessible even by boats to rescue people in the flood-wrecked state.
The Air Force's flood relief and rescue operations in Kerala saw many firsts, a top Air Force officer said.

                        The helicopter pilots flew with a very high situational awareness as rescuing people from homes surrounded by tall trees was a difficult and dangerous task that had no room for error. 
                        The flooded state's topography was such that all the aircraft got only a few places to land, the Air Force said.

"Everyone has done a fantastic job. Good coordination. 
The challenge was topography, Kerala is densely vegetated," Air Marshal B Suresh, AOC-in-C, Southern Air Command, told reporters today.
